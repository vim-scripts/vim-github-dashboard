:GHDashboard
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *:GHDashboard*
                                                       *:GHDashboard!*

Shows the dashboard of a user in a new tab.
(:GHDashboard! does not require authentication)


:GHActivity
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *:GHActivity*
                                                        *:GHActivity!*

Shows the activity stream of a user in a new tab.
(:GHActivity! does not require authentication)


Navigation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` to navigate back and forth through the links.

Press `Enter` key with the cursor on a link to open the link in the
default browser.

Press `q` to close the tab.


Authentication
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      *g:github_dashboard['username']*
                                      *g:github_dashboard['password']*

When you first run `:GHDashboard` or `:GHActivity` command,
you will be asked to enter your GitHub username and the password.
Once it is successfully authenticated, the Vim process will remember
the credentials and will no more ask for them.

If you don't want to be asked for username and password when running
the commands, you can set up `g:github_dashboard` variable as follows.

    let g:github_dashboard = { 'username': 'you', 'password': 'secret' }

Since having plain-text password in your .vimrc is not the most secure
thing you can do, it is strongly recommended that you put only
username in your Vim configuration file.

In fact, GitHub API allows you to browse dashboard or activity stream
without authentication, though the hourly rate is limited to 60.
Well, that's good enough as long as you don't check GitHub page every
minute. Use bang commands then: `:GHDashboard!` and `:GHActivity!`.


Optional configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         *g:github_dashboard['emoji']*
                                  *g:github_dashboard['open_command']*
                              *g:github_dashboard['api_open_timeout']*
                              *g:github_dashboard['api_read_timeout']*

    let g:github_dashboard = { 'username': 'you' }

    " Disable Emoji output
    " - Default: only enable on terminal Vim on Mac
    let g:github_dashboard['emoji'] = 0

    " Command to open link URLs
    " - Default: auto-detect
    let g:github_dashboard['open_command'] = 'open'

    " API timeout in seconds
    " - Default: 10, 20
    let g:github_dashboard['api_open_timeout'] = 10
    let g:github_dashboard['api_read_timeout'] = 20
